# Uber-Data-Analysis-Project
🚖 Uber Data Analysis

📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to uncover meaningful insights about ride patterns, customer behavior, peak booking times, and trip purposes. The analysis aims to understand how Uber rides are distributed across different time periods, locations, and categories.
The dataset contains detailed ride information including start date, end date, category (Business/Personal), pickup location, drop location, trip distance (miles), and purpose of the trip. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to identify trends and patterns in ride behavior.
During the analysis process, missing values were handled, date columns were converted into proper datetime format, and new time-based features such as month, day, and hour were extracted. This helped in analyzing seasonal trends and identifying peak ride hours.
# Several visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand:
Monthly ride distribution
Most frequent pickup locations
Business vs Personal ride comparison
Ride purpose distribution
Distance analysis
Peak booking hours
The analysis revealed that most rides occur during working hours, business trips are more frequent than personal trips, and certain locations have significantly higher ride demand.
